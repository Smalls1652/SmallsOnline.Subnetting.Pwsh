# `SmallsOnline.Subnetting.Pwsh`

_**A C#-based subnet calculator for PowerShell.**_

This repository is for a PowerShell module to perform subnetting of IPv4 address spaces. It is currently a work-in-progress. Core development is done through a C# class library I am working on called [`SmallsOnline.Subnetting.Lib`](https://github.com/Smalls1652/SmallsOnline.Subnetting).
